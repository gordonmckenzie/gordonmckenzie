# Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‡

I am a senior software engineer and [physician-scientist](https://www.hyms.ac.uk/about/people/gordon-mckenzie) ðŸ©º ðŸ§ª

ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; My PhD thesis explored the predictive assessment and optimisation of older adults with cancer. I designed, developed and evaluated an Android application (Kotlin) used in production for National Health Service patients. I also built a dashboard/micro-Electronic Patient Record for clinicians using a React(Nuxt.js)-Node.js-SQL stack. I developed a decision-analytic health economic model using Python to understand the cost-effectiveness of geriatric assessment prior to cancer treatment. I also engineered a complex model of an oncogeriatric population using synthetic data driven by machine learning. 

ðŸ¤” &nbsp; I'm finalising a digital twin to model older adults with cancer using numerous supervised machine learning algorithms (linear/logistic models, probabilistic graphical modelling, fuzzy logic, gradient-boosted decision trees and neural networks). This is all wrapped within a Python/PyData program, using a pipeline of unit/integration testing, automated analytics and High Performance Computing.

ðŸ˜ƒ &nbsp; I am the Clinical Lead at [Upstream Health](https://upstream.health) who have developed an Internet of Things device, designed to support informal carers and monitor those under their care called [Bridgit](https://bridgit.care). 

ðŸŒ± &nbsp; I'm starting to add more public repositories, covering a data engineering pipeline from simulating sensor data through to persistence in a data warehouse, with machine learning and analytics in between.
