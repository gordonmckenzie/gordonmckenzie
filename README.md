# Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‡

By background I am a medical doctor ðŸ©º &nbsp; and [researcher](https://www.hyms.ac.uk/about/people/gordon-mckenzie) ðŸ§ª 

ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; I'm currently finishing a PhD exploring the predictive assessment and optimisation of older adults with cancer. I've used a range of digital technologies throughout the last 3 years. To collect data from patients who I have recruited to my study, I designed, developed and evaluated an Android application (Kotlin) used in production for National Health Service patients. I also built a dashboard/micro-Electronic Patient Record for clinicians to understand all this data, using a React(Nuxt.js)-Node.js-SQL stack. 

ðŸ¤” &nbsp; I'm currently finishing an expert system to model this population using numerous supervised machine learning algorithms (linear/logistic models, probabilistic graphical modelling, fuzzy logic, gradient-boosted decision trees and neural networks). This is all wrapped within a Python/PyData program, using a pipeline of unit/integration testing, automated analytics and High Performance Computing.

ðŸ˜ƒ &nbsp; I am the Clinical Lead at [Upstream Health](https://upstream.health) who have developed an Internet of Things device, designed to support informal carers and monitor those under their care called [Bridgit](https://bridgit.care). 

ðŸŒ± &nbsp; I'm starting to add more public repositories, covering a data engineering pipeline from simulating sensor data through to persistence in a data warehouse, with machine learning and analytics in between. 

ðŸ’¬ &nbsp; Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gordon-a-g-mckenzie/) if you are interested in collaboration.
